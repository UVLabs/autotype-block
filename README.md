# Autotype Block

Shiny Gutenberg block which auto types a given sentence(s). Makes for great headers! But can also be added to normal paragraph text (not implemented).

Uses [Typed.js](https://mattboldt.com/demos/typed-js/) library.


## Usecases

- Page and Post Headers
- Standard paragraph text
- Nested inside other blocks

## Possible Future Improvements

- Add more google fonts
- Let users choose from multiple backgrounds by either creating custom ones or downloading from [Subtle Patterns](https://www.toptal.com/designers/subtlepatterns/) (requires attribution)
- Let users control the different [Typed.js options](https://github.com/mattboldt/typed.js#customization)

## Bugs

- Returning to editor after save shows invalid block, but block will still render on the frontend.

###### Gutenberg skills too poor currently to go further with this. Feel free to fork and extend, looking at you Hardeep ðŸ‘€.
